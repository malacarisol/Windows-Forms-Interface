# Windows-Forms-Interface

DESCRIPTION:

Here you will find a visual implementation of known algorithms as Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory and sorting algorithms on C#. You will be able to play with water jugs, add and delete nodes on a kind of node map, access to a existing database on Excel and sort its elements with different criteria. Hope you enjoy!

WARNING! The code was written in order to interact with Spanish talking people, but this is not a limitation to understand the code.

In order to implement this at Visual Studio you will need the Windows Forms extension. I highly recommend it as its easy to use.

Here we have 4 forms, in order to solve 4 known programming problems with different algorithms:

-"Ejercicio Uno" contains a solution to Knapsack problem with greedy algorithms as well as with dynamic programming. The idea is that you write the database of Cheeses you want to steel from a shop, the amount of weight you can carry and the values and weights of those cheeses. The algorithm will tell you what cheeses did he steal, and the total amount of cash it gathered.

-"Ejercicio 2" is a game, based on the Water Jug Problem, where we have 3 different Jugs (you enter the size of each on liters) with different amounts of water on each (you choose it also) and you are able to pass water from one jug to another till you reach the final result (you also choose it)

I recommend having jugs of 10, 7, 4 liters each. Initially, there are 2, 7, 2 litters on each one and you have to reach the result 4, 3, 4. You also can choose that the computer solves it and shows you the steps she did to reach the result.

-"Ejercicio 3" is kind of a game where you can add nodes and connect one to another, as long as the adyacent nodes have different colors. We already took care of it, so you can play and there will never be 2 adyacent nodes with the same color.

-"Ejercicio 4" uses diffent sorting techniques in order to sort the database we added here (.rar file). This database has 1048576 lines, "Country;Item Type;Order ID;Units Sold" and the goal is to order it by each criteria, with bubble sort, tim sort, quick sort, shell sort and more. 


Hope you enjoy.
